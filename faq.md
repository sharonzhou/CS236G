## What are the prerequisites for the course?
Students are expected to have the following background:
 * Familiarity with basic programming (CS106B or CS101)
 * Familiarity with basics of deep learning (CS230 or CS221)
 * Familiarity with the probability theory (CS 109 or STATS 116)
 * Familiarity with linear algebra (MATH 51)

## What is the grading breakdown?
Below is the breakdown of the class grade:
 * 50%: Final project - creativity and equal participation within a group will be rewarded
 * 25%: Midterm
 * 25%: Programming assignments & quizzes
 * 0%: Attendance
 * Extra credit: Your (or your GAN-generated) Memes. Requirements: Relevant and Appropriate with capital R and A there.

## What's up with lectures?
Lectures are Tuesdays & Thursdays 2:30-3:50PM PST over Zoom. Tuesdays will cover general material, and Thursdays will delve a bit deeper. Feel free to skip and post on Piazza if that's more your jam. 

## What are some ways I can do lecture, if I like learning that way?
You can watch the lectures live by going to Canvas, and going to the <a href="https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/117317/external_tools/5384">Zoom tab</a>. Recordings will also be posted after lecture onto Canvas.

## How can I contact the course staff?
All class communication happens on the [CS236G Piazza forum]({{ site.course.piazza }}). Please make sure to join! For private matters, please make a private note visible only to the course instructors. For longer discussions with TAs and to get help in person, we strongly encourage you to come to office hours. If you need to contact us via email, please email individual TAs.

## What are the components of this course?
* In-class lectures on Tuesdays: these lectures will be a mix of advanced lectures on a specific subject that hasn't been treated in depth in the videos or guest lectures from industry experts. You can access these lectures on the [Zoom tab on Canvas](https://canvas.stanford.edu/courses/117317/external_tools/5384), and they will also be posted afterwards on [Canvas](https://canvas.stanford.edu/).
* Two modules from the [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) on Coursera. You will watch videos at home, solve quizzes and programming assignments hosted on online notebooks.
* TA-led sections on Thursdays: Teaching Assistants will teach you hands-on tips and tricks to succeed, but also theorethical foundations.
* Project meeting with your TA mentor: CS236G is a project-based class. Through personalized guidance, TAs will help you succeed in implementing a successful GAN project this quarter.

## How do I submit assignments?
From the Coursera sessions (accessible from the invite you receive by email), you will be able to watch videos, solve quizzes and complete programming assignments. Each quiz and programming assignment can be submitted directly from the session and will be graded by our autograders.

You will submit your [project deliverables](/project/#project-deliverables) on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/000). You should be added to Gradescope automatically by the end of the first week. If not you can join with course code **TBD**.


## What does each [Coursera module](https://www.deeplearning.ai/generative-adversarial-networks-specialization/) contain?
* Videos. These are organized in "weeks". You will have to watch ≈10 videos (approx 10min each) every week.
 * In-video quizzes. These are sprinkled in every video for you to assess your understanding of the material.
 * Programming assignments (≈2h per week to complete). The programming assignments will usually lead you to build concrete algorithms, you will get to see your own result after you've completed all the code. It's gonna be fun! For both assignment and quizzes, follow the deadlines on the Syllabus page, not on Coursera.

## How is the final project graded?
The final project grade will incorporate the following components:
 * 5% Inspo: Find sources of inspiration that you think are cool, compile list
 * 5% Idea spew: Create a list of 3+ project ideas you'd be interested in exploring - data and/or application and/or model have to be novel
 * 10% I haz the data: Get the data and enough of it. Show off some examples.
 * 20% Inkling: Run a baseline model on your data and get cracking!
 * 20% Ignition on: Get a better SOTA (or your own) model running.
 * 25% Invest in a risk: Let your creative juices take the reins for a bit and decide what to do for an experiment or two. It doesn't have to work, improve anything, etc. It probably won't, but you do it because it might and you're kind of curious.
 * 15% Equal participation within your pair (N/A if flying solo): This to reduce the case where 1 person does all the work, and make it a bit easier on an individual.

Deadlines are listed in the project page and on the schedule page of the website.

## Is it okay to use a dataset that is not public?
Yes, but it's not encouraged. You will have to be able to describe it, and show generated data. 

## Can I share the CS236G project with another class's project?
Yes, we're OK with it -- as long as your other class is OK with it. Just make sure to specify that you are doing that, and we ask that you have the same student partners there and here.

## How many people can be on a team?
Max 2 people per team -- or feel free to do the project alone. A larger team size will be taken under consideration when evaluating the scope of the project in breadth and depth, meaning that a 2-person team is expected to accomplish more than a 1-person team would.

## Where can I find some project inspiration?
[Awesome GAN](https://github.com/nightrome/really-awesome-gan)

## What is the late day policy for this course?
No late days. We won't grade them. You'll probably still do fine in the class.

## How can I receive accomodations for a documented disability?
Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the [Office of Accessible Education](https://oae.stanford.edu/) (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066).

## What is the honor code policy for this course?
[The Stanford Honor Code](https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code)

[The Stanford Honor Code as it pertains to CS courses](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1164/handouts/honor-code.pdf)

We strongly encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on programming assignments and quizzes in groups. However, each student must write down the solutions independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. In other words, each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by him/herself. In addition, each student should submit his/her own code and mention anyone he/she collaborated with. It is also an honor code violation to copy, refer to, or look at written or code solutions from a previous year, including but not limited to: official solutions from a previous year, solutions posted online, and solutions you or someone else may have written up in a previous year. Furthermore, it is an honor code violation to post your assignment solutions online, such as on a public git repo.

## Is there a textbook or other resource I could use to supplement my learning?
Not officially, but great resources are Deep Generative Models (Ch. 20) in [The Deep Learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and Deep Learning (Ch. 21) in [AI: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).

## Can I audit CS236G?
Yes! If you have a Stanford ID. You'll get access to some materials (but likely not all).
